Throughout the Bootcamp, I’ve developed a wide range of valuable skills, including:

-Frontend Development: Building responsive user interfaces using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and basic UI/UX principles.
-Backend & APIs: Setting up servers with Node.js/Express, working with REST APIs, and handling data using Firebase and MongoDB.
-Version Control & Collaboration: Using Git and GitHub effectively to manage projects, work in teams, and track progress.
-Problem-Solving: Learning how to break down complex coding problems and research solutions independently.
-Soft Skills: Strengthening my communication, time management, and teamwork abilities—essential for both remote and in-person  work environments.

So yes, Ifeel increasingly confident and prepared to begin the next step in my career. The Bootcamp has provided a solid foundation not only in technical skills but also in collaboration, problem-solving, and project management. I’ve been actively applying what I’ve learned through hands-on projects, and I now feel equipped to take on real-world challenges in a professional setting—especially in roles related to frontend development, full-stack engineering, or technical support.
